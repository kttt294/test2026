"""
Greedy baseline planner.

Strategy:
  Patrol cars: each picks the nearest spot belonging to a series not yet
               collected this game. Falls back to nearest uncollected spot
               in any series if all series are covered.
  Supply cars: move towards the patrol car with the lowest remaining fuel
               that is more than 1 hex away.

This is O(n_agents × n_spots) per day and finishes in <1 ms — safe as
a fallback when the main planner fails.
